# Unity - ShaderGraph

You must use Unity 2020 LTS or later for this project. You will be using Unity’s ShaderGraph tool to create different shaders and effects. You are not expected to exactly replicate the examples given – you have the creative freedom to design your shaders to look cartoon-y, realistic, pixelated, etc., but a non-technical person must be able to look at your shader example and recognize it as glowing or as water, etc.

ShaderGraph has the benefit of being a visual tool so that you can see exactly how each node, property, and mathematical function affects your shader. In order to fully take advantage of ShaderGraph’s capabilities, you must familiarize yourself with the functions of its nodes.

This project will be different in that you will not be required to provide a build as the last task. Instead, you will be exporting an Asset package containing your shaders. For each task’s manual review, your shaders will be applied to different GameObjects and evaluated on their appearance and performance.

What you should learn

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

What is rendering
What is a render pipeline
What is Unity’s Scriptable Render Pipeline
What is a shader
What is ShaderGraph and how is it used
How to setup a new project that utilizes ShaderGraph
What is the difference between surface, vertex and fragment shaders
What is UV mapping
What is vertex animation
Requirements for Unity projects
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
Use Unity’s default .gitignore in your holbertonschool-unity directory
Push the entire project folder unity-shaders to your repo
